- Send etaHEN payload option
- Re-Install YouTube using etaHEN DPI v2
- Upload download0.dat from PC to PS5
- Auto-Replace download0.dat on PS5 with YT2JB Autoloader download0.dat
- Patch app.db/appinfo.db/param.json to fully block YouTube from being updated
- Auto-Block over FTP option to fully block YouTube from being updated directly on PS5
- Download y2jb_update.zip to an USB drive
- Send a custom payload to the PS5

## Notes
- Most buttons have Tooltips for more information
- The 'Send etaHEN payload' option first downloads etaHEN v2.5b and stores it in the Cache folder, the second send will be faster
- When using the 'Auto-Block over FTP option' it is recommended to stay in the Settings of the PS5 to avoid any crashes
